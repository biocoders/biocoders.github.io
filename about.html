        <p class="lead">Who we are</p>
        <p>Every aspect of our lives is computerized and digitalized. Research is no different. Scientists have been using many software tools for many years.
            Machine learning and big data have become important aspects of scientific research. Scientists not only use already created tools by software developers
            but also write their own code for various reasons: from enhancing the capabilities of existing tools to creating new tools for their particular research purposes.
            Most of the time, they learn how to code by teaching themselves without any professional guidance. Internet is a big help in the problems they encounter.
            Nevertheless, despite all the available resources that can be reached individually, is there a better way?</p>
        <p>We are two graduate science students with a software development background. Working with our peers, we realized that we could provide some guidance to researchers in their coding experiences. We also know that using a specific tool can make us an expert in that tool, making anyone capable of helping others learn how to use the same tool.
        </p>
        <p>We are not the first to think that collaboration would make scientists’ jobs easier when it comes to computing. Sarah Stevens and colleagues have written a very nice article titled ‘Building a local community of practice in scientific programming for life’ (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005561). The idea of creating a “coders club” was not ours to start with either. Dr. John Stead from Carleton University had this brilliant idea to bring together Neuroscience grad students who do coding or want to learn how to code. As two members of this club, we decided to take this one step further and design a long-term community with different components: From synchronous online meetings to chat boards to share our struggles and experiences. The truth is that we all have things to learn from each other. Being self-taught can cause intimidation in searching for help. Stackoverflow can be an extremely helpful internet source for many problems, but it can also be intimidating for non-developers. We are all in the same boat. Rowing together will make us move faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are familiar with biology and neuroscience (hence the name BioCoders), but what we want to share may be helpful to our areas as well.
